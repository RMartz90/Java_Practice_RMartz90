# Java_Practice_Repo

## Purpose:
It is to create a repo for the basic Java exercises for my own practice.

## Scope:
* Only Java Coding.
* No Maven or Gradle Projects.

## Core Principles
- Class – A blueprint defining attributes (data) and methods (operations) 
- Object – A specific instance of a class, with its own state and behavior 
- Encapsulation – Bundling data and methods within a class while hiding internal state; access controlled via modifiers 
- Abstraction – Exposing essential features while concealing implementation details; achieved with abstract classes or interfaces 
- Inheritance – Enables a class (subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from another (superclass), promoting code reuse and hierarchy 
- Polymorphism – Allows methods to behave differently based on object type; includes compile‑time (overloading) and run‑time (overriding) polymorphism 

## Object Relationships
- Association – General relationship where objects reference each other (no dependency implied) 
- Aggregation – A “has‑a” relationship where child objects can exist independently of the parent 
- Composition – A stronger “has‑a” relationship where child objects depend entirely on the parent’s lifecycle
